#### Network Architecture:

- **Overview:**
  - The Transformer is a sequence transduction model that relies entirely on self-attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely.
  - Comprises an encoder and a decoder, both of which are stacks of layers that include multi-head self-attention mechanisms and position-wise feed-forward networks.
  - **Key Features:**
    - **Multi-Head Attention:** Allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces.
    - **Positional Encoding:** Introduces information about the relative or absolute position of tokens in the sequence.

- **Model Architecture Diagram:**
  - **Encoder Stack:**
    - Consists of \( N = 6 \) identical layers.
    - Each layer has two sub-layers:
      - Multi-head self-attention mechanism.
      - Position-wise fully connected feed-forward network.
  - **Decoder Stack:**
    - Also consists of \( N = 6 \) identical layers.
    - Each layer has three sub-layers:
      - Masked multi-head self-attention mechanism (to prevent attending to future positions).
      - Multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack.
      - Position-wise fully connected feed-forward network.

- **Detailed Layer-by-Layer Description:**

  - **Input Embedding Layer:**
    - Converts input tokens into vectors of dimension \( d_{\text{model}} = 512 \).
    - Embeddings are scaled by \( \sqrt{d_{\text{model}}} \) and summed with positional encodings.

  - **Positional Encoding:**
    - Adds positional information to the embeddings.
    - Calculated using sine and cosine functions of varying frequencies:

      $$
      \begin{align*}
      \text{PE}_{(pos, 2i)} &= \sin\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{\frac{2i}{d_{\text{model}}}}}\right), \\
      \text{PE}_{(pos, 2i+1)} &= \cos\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{\frac{2i}{d_{\text{model}}}}}\right).
      \end{align*}
      $$

      - **Variables:**
        - \( pos \): Position index in the sequence.
        - \( i \): Dimension index.
        - \( d_{\text{model}} \): Model dimensionality (512).

  - **Encoder Layer (repeated \( N = 6 \) times):**

    - **Sub-layer 1: Multi-Head Self-Attention**

      - **Purpose:** Allows the model to attend to all positions in the input sequence.

      - **Scaled Dot-Product Attention:**

        $$
        \text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{Q K^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right) V
        $$

        - **Variables:**
          - \( Q \): Query matrix.
          - \( K \): Key matrix.
          - \( V \): Value matrix.
          - \( d_k \): Dimension of the keys (64).

        - **Explanation:**
          1. Compute dot products between queries and keys.
          2. Scale by \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{d_k}} \) to prevent large values of dot products.
          3. Apply softmax to obtain attention weights.
          4. Multiply by values to get the output.

      - **Multi-Head Attention:**

        $$
        \begin{align*}
        \text{head}_i &= \text{Attention}(Q W_i^Q, K W_i^K, V W_i^V), \\
        \text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) &= \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, \dots, \text{head}_h) W^O.
        \end{align*}
        $$

        - **Variables:**
          - \( W_i^Q, W_i^K, W_i^V \): Projection matrices for the \( i \)-th head.
          - \( W^O \): Output projection matrix.
          - \( h \): Number of heads (8).

        - **Explanation:**
          1. Project queries, keys, and values \( h \) times with different learned linear projections.
          2. Perform scaled dot-product attention in parallel.
          3. Concatenate the outputs and project to obtain the final values.

    - **Sub-layer 2: Position-wise Feed-Forward Network**

      - **Definition:**

        $$
        \text{FFN}(x) = \text{ReLU}(x W_1 + b_1) W_2 + b_2
        $$

        - **Variables:**
          - \( x \): Input from the previous sub-layer.
          - \( W_1, W_2 \): Weight matrices.
          - \( b_1, b_2 \): Bias vectors.

        - **Dimensions:**
          - Input and output dimensionality: \( d_{\text{model}} = 512 \).
          - Inner-layer dimensionality: \( d_{\text{ff}} = 2048 \).

      - **Explanation:**
        - Applies two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.
        - Operates separately and identically on each position.

    - **Residual Connections and Layer Normalization:**

      - Each sub-layer is wrapped with a residual connection followed by layer normalization.
      - Output of sub-layer: \( \text{LayerNorm}(x + \text{Sublayer}(x)) \).

  - **Decoder Layer (repeated \( N = 6 \) times):**

    - **Sub-layer 1: Masked Multi-Head Self-Attention**

      - Similar to encoder's self-attention but prevents positions from attending to subsequent positions.
      - Ensures that predictions for position \( i \) depend only on positions less than \( i \).

    - **Sub-layer 2: Multi-Head Attention over Encoder Output**

      - Allows each position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence.

    - **Sub-layer 3: Position-wise Feed-Forward Network**

      - Same as in the encoder.

    - **Residual Connections and Layer Normalization:**

      - As in the encoder, residual connections wrap each sub-layer, followed by layer normalization.

- **Pseudo-code Representation:**

  h = 8                             % Number of attention heads
  d_k = d_v = d_model / h = 64      % Dimension per head

  % Encoder Layer Function

      % Multi-head self-attention sub-layer
      SelfAttentionOutput = MultiHeadAttention(Q=x, K=x, V=x)
      % Add & Norm
      x = LayerNorm(x + SelfAttentionOutput)
      % Position-wise feed-forward sub-layer

          x = EncoderLayer(x)
      EncoderOutput = x

      % Decoder Stack
      y = Embedding(output_sequence_shifted_right) + PositionalEncoding(output_sequence_shifted_right)
      for i = 1 to N:
          y = DecoderLayer(y, EncoderOutput)
      % Final Linear and Softmax Layer
      output = Softmax(Linear(y))
      return output
  ```

  - **Note:**
    - The pseudo-code provides a high-level representation of the Transformer model's operations.
    - The mask in the decoder's masked self-attention prevents access to future tokens.

#### Activation Functions:

- **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):**
  - Used in the position-wise feed-forward networks.
  - Defined as \( \text{ReLU}(x) = \max(0, x) \).

- **Softmax:**
  - Used in the scaled dot-product attention to compute attention weights.
  - Also used at the final output layer to compute probabilities over the target vocabulary.

#### Cost Function and Optimization:

- **Cost Function:**
  - The negative log-likelihood of the correct token in the target sequence, computed after applying the softmax function.

- **Label Smoothing:**
  - Applied during training with a smoothing factor \( \epsilon_{\text{ls}} = 0.1 \).
  - Distributes some probability mass away from the true target token to other tokens.
  - Helps prevent the model from becoming overconfident.

- **Optimization Algorithm:**
  - **Adam Optimizer:**
    - Parameters:
      - \( \beta_1 = 0.9 \)
      - \( \beta_2 = 0.98 \)
      - \( \epsilon = 10^{-9} \)
  - **Learning Rate Schedule:**
    - The learning rate \( \text{lrate} \) is adjusted over time according to:

      $$
      \text{lrate} = d_{\text{model}}^{-0.5} \cdot \min\left(\text{step\_num}^{-0.5}, \text{step\_num} \cdot \text{warmup\_steps}^{-1.5}\right)
      $$

      - **Variables:**
        - \( d_{\text{model}} = 512 \): Model dimensionality.
        - \( \text{step\_num} \): Current training step number.
        - \( \text{warmup\_steps} = 4000 \): Number of warmup steps.

    - **Explanation:**
      - The learning rate increases linearly during the warmup phase.
      - After the warmup phase, it decreases proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number.
